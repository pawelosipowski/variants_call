RECKONER - Read Error Corrector Based on KMC


1. RECKONER
RECKONER is a tool for correction of Illumina reads. It is based
on the error correction algorithm BLESS and utilizes the following tools:
- KMC2 for k-mer counting,
- kmc_tools for trimming a k-mer database.

2. Compilation
RECKONER is available for Linux. To compile RECKONER
use g++ version 4.9.2 or newer by typing "make", as a result
there will be generated executable files in the "bin" directory.

3. Running
To run RECKONER execute script "run.sh" from the "bin" directory (typically
by typing "./run.sh ARGUMENTS").

As ARGUMENTS type the following:
- k (k-mer length),
- output directory; if it does not exist, it will be created,
- number of threads,
- list of input FASTQ files.

After running, RECKONER will perform the following actions:
- k-mer counting with KMC2,
- determining of a cutoff threshold,
- k-mer database trimming and converting,
- read error correcting.

Result files will be created in the output directory with a "corrected" suffix.

Examples:
./run.sh 25 results 16 SRR088579.fastq.gz
./run.sh 30 results 8 ERR729973.fastq ERR729974.fastq
